## [3.13.3] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed: Complete Fix for `&&` Shell Operator

#### Bug #3 Continued: `&&` Still Blocked by Command Validator
- **Issue**: Previous fix `r'(?<!\d)&(?![&\d>])'` only handled the FIRST `&` in `&&`, not the second
- **Root cause**: The second `&` in `&&` is preceded by `&` (not a digit), so the lookbehind passed
- **Fix**: Updated lookbehind to `(?<![&\d])` - now excludes both digits AND ampersands

Final pattern: `r'(?<![&\d])&(?![&\d>])'`
- Allows: `&&` (sequential), `2>&1` (stderr redirect), `&>` (redirect)
- Blocks: `command &` (background execution)
