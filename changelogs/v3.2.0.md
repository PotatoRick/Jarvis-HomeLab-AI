## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-01

### BackupStale Host Determination Fix

**"Fixing Alerts on the Right Host"**

This release fixes a critical issue where Jarvis was executing backup remediation commands on the wrong host.

### Added

#### Prometheus Alert Enhancements
- **`remediation_host` label**: All alerts now include explicit label specifying where fixes should run
- **`remediation_hint` annotation**: Human-readable guidance for AI
- **`remediation_commands` annotation**: Suggested commands to execute

### Fixed

- **BackupStale executing on wrong host**: Home Assistant backup alerts now correctly target Skynet
- **Misleading instance labels**: `skynet:9100` (node_exporter) no longer confuses the host resolver
