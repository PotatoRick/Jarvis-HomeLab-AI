## [3.13.2] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed: Allow `&&` Shell Operator (Incomplete)

**Note: This fix was incomplete - see v3.13.3 for the complete fix.**

#### Bug #3: `&&` Blocked by Command Validator
- **Issue**: Pattern `r'(?<!\d)&(?![\d>])'` was blocking `test -f ... && echo 'exists'` commands
- **Root cause**: The pattern was designed to block background `&` but didn't account for `&&` (sequential execution)
- **Partial Fix**: Updated pattern to `r'(?<!\d)&(?![&\d>])'` - but this only fixed the first `&` in `&&`
