## [3.13.1] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed: Critical Bug Fixes for Dockerfile Remediation

#### Bug #1: Health Check Command Extraction
- **Issue**: Docker inspect returns `{"Test": [...]}` (capitalized) but code was looking for `{"test": [...]}`
- **Fix**: Changed `health_config.get("test", [])` to `health_config.get("Test", [])` in health_check_remediation.py

#### Bug #2: `docker exec` Blocked by Validator
- **Issue**: Pattern `r'\bexec\s'` was blocking `docker exec container sh -c` diagnostic commands
- **Fix**: Updated pattern to `r'(?<!docker\s)\bexec\s'` to allow `docker exec` while still blocking shell builtin `exec`
