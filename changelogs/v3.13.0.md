## [3.13.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added: Autonomous Dockerfile Remediation (Phase 7)

**"Jarvis now fixes container crash loops the same way you would - by patching the Dockerfile"**

This release enables Jarvis to autonomously resolve container crash loops that require Docker image modifications.

### Added

#### Autonomous Health Check Remediation (`app/health_check_remediation.py`)
- **Full diagnosis flow**: Extracts health check config, runs check inside container, identifies failure cause
- **Error pattern recognition**: Maps common errors ("curl: not found") to package installations
- **Base image awareness**: Knows which package manager to use for debian, alpine, etc.
- **Dockerfile patching**: Locates compose directory, backs up Dockerfile, inserts fix instruction
- **Automatic rebuild**: Runs `docker compose build` and `docker compose up -d`
- **Verification loop**: Waits for container to become healthy, rolls back on failure

#### New Claude Tools
- **`fix_container_crash_loop`**: Full autonomous fix - diagnose, patch, rebuild, verify
- **`diagnose_health_check`**: Read-only diagnosis without making changes
