## [3.0.1] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed

- **RiskLevel enum lookup bug**: Fixed case-sensitivity issue when loading learned patterns from database
  - Pattern matching failed with `KeyError: 'low'` when `risk_level` was stored in lowercase
  - Now normalizes to uppercase before enum lookup (`RiskLevel[risk_level.upper()]`)
  - Affected alerts like `BackupHealthCheckStale` that matched learned patterns
