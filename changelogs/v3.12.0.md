## [3.12.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added: Proactive Anomaly Remediation (Phase 6 Enhancement)

**"Jarvis now silently fixes sustained anomalies before they become critical alerts"**

---

### Added

#### Sustained Anomaly Tracking
- **Consecutive detection counting**: Anomalies must persist for 3+ consecutive checks (~15 minutes) before triggering remediation
- **Spike filtering**: Temporary CPU/memory spikes from builds, backups, etc. are ignored

#### Proactive Remediation Pipeline
- **Synthetic alert generation**: Sustained anomalies create alerts that flow through the standard remediation pipeline
- **Silent resolution**: Issues are fixed without notification unless escalation is needed

#### Daily Anomaly Reports
- **Scheduled at 8 AM local time**: Summary sent to Discord (only if there were synthetic alerts)
